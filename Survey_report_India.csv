Your thought process and concern is very good and needed in the modern times. Just to add one thing to get more realistic answers for your survey do put blank options where a user can add specific answers if they had anything in their mind regarding to a particular question. 
Certainly, E waste is and will be more disturbing thing with in the increasing share of electronics in the every corner of human life dependencies. While working in automotive cybersecurity and software doamin I'm assuring you managing E waste coming from vehicles will be far more than our present gadgets available with us.

All the best for your journey ahead.

Proper management of e-waste is critical to mitigating its harmful effects on the environment and human health. E-waste contains hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can leach into the soil and water, causing contamination. However, e-waste also holds valuable materials like gold, silver, and copper that can be recovered and reused. Addressing e-waste involves promoting sustainable practices such as recycling, extending the lifespan of electronics through repair and refurbishment, and encouraging manufacturers to design products with end-of-life disposal in mind. Effective policies and consumer awareness are essential to managing e-waste responsibly and reducing its ecological footprint."
